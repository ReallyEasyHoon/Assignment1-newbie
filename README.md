Project name: PERSONAL PROTFIOLO

This website is intent to propose my personal portfolio, Certification, expereience and contact me.


 During my ITE time i desgin similar website using html5 and java. The first design was to put my photo at the center of the first page but due to to less content, i decided to put the photo at the left side follow by short description of myself, below the sort descripts was my school and personal email. Some features are allow user to nagivate to different pages using "a href" and store inside a list.


 Next will be the contact me page, on the page itself you will see two button one is submit and another is send email, the different between this two button was one is to directly email me through the email app on desktop and the second button was to submit the name,email and contact number through the website

 Testing: The contact me page will verify how the error message will appear if you didn't follow the require field pattern.  During the testing i found out quite alot of bugs like the pic wasn't loaded when i try to use different webpage size to load the project, i found out that the reason is because i didn't download the image to my local drive and i wasn't connected to any network so the image cant be loaded. I solve the problem by downloading all the images and place it on my local drive.
