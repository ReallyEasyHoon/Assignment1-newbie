            <p>I was assigned to Academy Of Singapore Teachers (AST) as intern for 2months when I was still at ITE higher Nitec.
                 During my internship at AST, my team and I was tasked to complete a project which include Robotic Process Automation(RPA).</p>

            <p>I was assigned to help elderly in class. As some of the elderly may have problem catching up with the lesson coach.
                 I remembered helping this elder who don't understand what the coach is teaching, after 1 hour of the lesson the elderly
                  told me that she don't understand. I have to teach her how to use Wireless@SG app.</p>

            my team and I will go to Taman Jurong CC after school to help the elderly who have inquiries regarding their smartphone.
             I learned some new skill, like communicating with elderly better and  
             problem which most of the elderly faced after a few months of interacting with them </p>

            <p>This photo was taken before we leave Singapore for the YEP trip to Thailand. 
                Our project for YEP is to build a wall for the children from one of the kindergartens in Chiangmai.
                 We chose this project because the old wall that was built quite a long time ago has broke. 
                 For the safety of those children, we decided to build a more sturdy wall that can better protect them from getting injured
                  (as the kindergarten is located on a roadside)</p>

        <p> This photo was taken as part of the ACE team project. 
            We organized a Zoom meeting with the elderly from Taman Jurong CC to let them know more about cybersecurity and
             teach them how to edit videos using VivaCut. I learned new app like VIvaCut which is for video editing. </p>
